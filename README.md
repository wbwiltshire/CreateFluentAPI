# CreateFluentAPI
A tutorial on creating a Fluent API for a C# library

There are several ways to create a Fluent API:

  1. Use Extension methods 
  1. User Interfaces and sub-classes
  
### Extension methods
* Best for libraries you don't control and just want to extend
### User Interface / Sub-classes
* Best for libraries you design and support

### Requirements
  1. Needs to be Fluent
  2. Should "Guide" the user in creating the flow
  3. Should only present options that make sense
  4. Should support configuration using Lambdas
